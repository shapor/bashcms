bashcms was originally written to generate the html for the http://tux3.org
website.  It uses html stub file and a some simple metadata file, which are
included as an example.

The html used for the templates is from the following css tab example:
http://labs.silverorange.com/images/tabsupdate/index.html

Simply running "make" will generate html files.
Pages to generate are listed in .templates/order
Their metadata is store in directories:
$ cat .templates/order
index about
$ tree -a index about
index
|-- .index.html
`-- .name
about
`-- .index.html

Template files:
order: (one line) the list of files to generate, in the order they will be displayed
header.html: Top of all the html files, followed by the generated menu
middle.html: displayed between the menu and the .index.html content
footer.html: take a wild guess :)

Metadata files:
.name: (optional) contains the link name to be displayed in the tab header
.index.html: the content of the file to be generated

TODO:
add <title> support in headers
add subtab support
